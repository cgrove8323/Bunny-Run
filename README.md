## How to Play

  * Spikemen that walk across the bottom of the screen
  * Spikeballs that guard various platforms throughout the level
  * Flymen that hover around the level
  
### Powerups
* Carrots: the orange carrots on the screen give you health, or "Hearts". The maximum amount of hearts you can have is 3, but if you run out of hearts, you lose a life and will have to start at the beginning o the level.
* Jetpack: The jetpack will send you to the top of the screen and let you fly across the level for 3 seconds. However, be careful because you may fly so far that you'll miss some coins and powerups, but if you're crunched for time, use this for easy transport.
* Bunny Icon: The small blue diamonds with a bunny shape in the middle give you extra lives, so if you are running low, grab one of these to keep you in the game. When all your lives run out, you lose the game.
* Bubble: The bubbles will give you 5 seconds of invincibility. During this time, you will be able to run through enemies without losing hearts.
